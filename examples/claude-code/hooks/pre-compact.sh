# coord PreCompact hook — brief-024 hook-legs.
#
# Fires just before Claude Code compacts the current context. Compaction
# wipes the model's in-context state; without a flush, everything the
# model knew about the current task is gone. This hook's job is to
# make sure `context/now.md` reflects reality *right now*, so the
# boot-rehydrate path (SessionStart) has fresh state to inject.
#
# HARD CONSTRAINT: exit 0 ALWAYS, no matter what. Compaction is a
# load-bearing operation — a hung or crashing hook that blocks it
# would wedge the entire session. All failure modes fall through to
# `exit 0`, and all error output is redirected to a file under
# `<coord-root>/<identity>/context/.flush-errors.log`; NEVER stderr,
# because Claude Code surfaces our stderr as a system-reminder in the
# very next turn — which would flood every post-compaction context
# with hook chatter.
#
# What it actually does:
#   1. Refuses cleanly if $COORD_IDENTITY / $ST_IDENTITY / $ST_AGENT
#      is unset (nothing meaningful to flush).
#   2. If `now.md` exists AND was written in the last 5 minutes, we
#      trust that the model already flushed. No action.
#   3. Otherwise, writes a "compaction-fired stub" to `now.md` via
#      `coord context write` (atomic tmp+rename). Boot-rehydrate will
#      inject the stub as a `<context>` block; the model sees "the
#      last thing that happened was compaction, no fresh state was
#      captured, reconstruct from git+inbox."
#
# The 5-minute freshness threshold is deliberately loose — the model
# should be flushing at each meaningful state change, but if it's
# been quietly working for a few minutes without flushing, we don't
# want to clobber that quiet-but-current work with a stub. Threshold
# is tunable via $COORD_PRECOMPACT_FRESH_S (seconds; default 300).
#
# 500ms hard cap via `timeout` (falls back to `gtimeout` on darwin
# systems with coreutils installed; falls through unbounded when
# neither is present — no exit-status change; the hook's other work
# should complete in single-digit ms anyway, so the cap is defense-
# in-depth, not a load-bearing invariant).

# now — pre-compact stub — $ts

PreCompact fired without a recent flush from the model. Boot-rehydrate
should treat this as "no fresh state captured" and reconstruct from
git status, recent commits, and open inbox items.

If you see this after a restart: your last known-good working-state
was NOT captured before compaction. That's a discipline miss (the
base-persona rule is to flush \`coord context write\` at each
meaningful state change), not a hook bug. Reconstruct and flush
proactively going forward.

# Run the write under a 500ms cap. `timeout` isn't universally present
# on darwin — try `timeout`, then `gtimeout`, then unbounded. Any
# failure of the write itself sinks to $err_log via the `2>>` on the
# pipeline. `|| true` on every branch guarantees we never inherit a
# non-zero status from the write.
# We do NOT pass `$identity` as a positional to `coord context write`.
# Passing it positionally would trigger the anti-impersonation strict
# check in resolveAgent (explicit id → folder must pre-exist,
# AgentNotHostedError otherwise). Instead we rely on the env-var
# fallback path (ST_AGENT / ST_IDENTITY / COORD_IDENTITY) — same
# resolution chain we used above to derive $identity, so the
# resolved id is guaranteed identical — which takes the implicit
# lazy-create branch and mkdirs `inbox/`+`archive/` on first flush.
