# Codex hooks for coord

Reference scripts that wire coord into [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/) via its hook system. They make Codex aware of unread coord messages without requiring real-time push (Codex has no channel equivalent — only these polling-style hooks).

## What's in here

- **`session-start.sh`** — `SessionStart` hook. Reads `$COORD_ROOT/$COORD_IDENTITY/inbox/` via `coord message ls --json` and emits the unread snapshot as `additionalContext` so the agent sees pending coord messages the moment it boots.
- **`stop.sh`** — `Stop` hook. Same shape, run when the agent goes idle. Tracks a state file (`$XDG_STATE_HOME/coord-codex-hooks/last-checked.txt`) so it only reports messages that arrived since the previous Stop — empty delta means silent idle.
- **`config.toml.example`** — `~/.codex/config.toml` fragment registering `coord mcp` as an MCP server and pointing the hook entries at the two scripts above.

## Install

1. Make sure `coord` and `jq` are on your `$PATH`.
2. Copy or symlink the two `.sh` scripts into `~/.codex/hooks/` (or anywhere Codex can read; the config snippet expects absolute paths).
3. Merge `config.toml.example` into your `~/.codex/config.toml`. Update the `command = "/full/path/to/..."` lines to point at wherever you placed the scripts.
4. Set `COORD_ROOT` and `COORD_IDENTITY` in the shell that launches `codex` — the `env_vars` passthrough in the MCP block hands them to `coord mcp`, and the hooks read them directly.
5. Restart Codex.

## What you get

- **At session start**: the agent's first turn sees an `additionalContext` block listing every file in your inbox with sender + subject. It can then call `coord_msg_read` (via the MCP server registered in the same config) to inspect any of them.
- **On idle**: the Stop hook re-checks for arrivals since the previous Stop. Only NEW messages trigger the injection; quiet inboxes idle silently.
- **Verbs**: `coord_msg_send`, `coord_msg_ls`, `coord_msg_read`, `coord_msg_archive`, `coord_msg_thread` — the same five tools every other MCP host gets. Use them in chat the way you'd use a built-in capability.

## Push mode (`coord ding`)

Codex itself has no channel equivalent, so push semantics come from outside the agent: run Codex inside a `pty` session, then arm `coord ding` against that session. The daemon watches the inbox + status, and on every new arrival pty-sends a one-line notice into Codex when the agent is `available` (or `offline`); `busy` and `dnd` buffer the notice until status flips back.

```sh
# In one terminal: run Codex inside a named pty session
pty run --name codex-foo -- codex

# In another: arm the ding daemon for that session
COORD_ROOT=~/.local/state/coord COORD_IDENTITY=me \
  coord ding codex-foo --interval 2000
```

The daemon is long-running; pair with `pty up` (or systemd, launchd, etc.) for restart-on-crash. Set `coord status me --set busy` to stop deliveries while a turn is mid-flight; `coord status me --set available` flushes the buffered notices.

## Limitations

- **Hooks alone aren't push**. The `SessionStart` and `Stop` hooks fire at the boundaries of a turn — coord messages that arrive *mid-turn* don't surface until the next Stop. Combine with `coord ding` (above) for true push, or run Codex alongside a Claude Code session in channel mode (see [walkthrough.md](../../notes/walkthrough.md)).
- **Filename-ts filtering**. `stop.sh` filters by the `<unix-ms>` prefix of the filename. Sync-delivered files whose prefix is older than the last checkpoint are missed — Stop is a notification cue, not a backfill audit.
- **Single-identity assumption**. The state file is global; running Codex with different `COORD_IDENTITY` values against the same `$HOME` will cross-pollinate the cursor. If that bites, edit the script to scope the state path under `$COORD_IDENTITY`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Nothing happens on session start.** Check `$COORD_ROOT` and `$COORD_IDENTITY` are exported in the shell that launches Codex; if they're empty the hook exits non-zero with a stderr message that Codex usually surfaces in its log.
- **`coord-codex-hook: jq not on PATH`**. Install `jq` (`brew install jq`, `apt install jq`, etc.). The hook uses jq to construct the JSON envelope.
- **The same messages keep getting injected on every Stop.** The state file isn't being written. Check that `$XDG_STATE_HOME/coord-codex-hooks/` (or `~/.local/state/coord-codex-hooks/`) is writable.
